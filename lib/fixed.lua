Integer-only numeric kernel for `random`.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
Every function in here replaces a libm call that `bin/random` used to make
(math.log, math.cos, math.exp, math.pow). Those had to go, because THEY ARE
NOT PORTABLE. IEEE-754 pins down + - * / and sqrt, and says essentially
nothing about transcendental functions, so every libc is free to return a
different final ulp — and they do. Measured on one machine, glibc vs musl,
over the exact k/2^32 domain this program feeds them:

    sqrt   identical      (IEEE-754 mandates correct rounding)
    log    differs        0.006% of inputs
    cos    differs        3.06%  of inputs
    exp    differs        8.85%  of inputs

Box-Muller calls log AND cos per variate, so about 3% of seeded "normal"
values differed between a glibc build and a musl build OF THE SAME SOURCE AT
THE SAME SEED. For a tool whose entire purpose is reproducible streams — the
driving use case is deterministic fuzzing, where a corpus must replay a crash
on someone else's machine — that is not a rounding quirk, it is a broken
promise with no error message.

And it is worth saying plainly why this had to be written at all: the industry
tolerates this. The standard response to "your seeded RNG returns different
numbers on my machine" is a shrug and some line about how it's only the last
ulp and floating point is hard. That excuse is nonsense. It is only the last
ulp until it changes a comparison, and then it is a different branch, a
different variate, a different stream, and a bug report nobody can reproduce.
Reproducibility was the entire specification. Shipping math that quietly
depends on which libc got linked, and then calling the resulting
irreproducibility acceptable, is a choice — a lazy one — and everyone has
agreed to keep making it for decades rather than spend an afternoon on integer
arithmetic. This file is that afternoon.

DO NOT "SIMPLIFY" ANY OF THIS BACK INTO A math.* CALL. Doing so silently
destroys the cross-platform guarantee and no test that runs on a single
machine will notice.

REPRESENTATION
==============
Normalized binary soft-float, all integer ops:

    value = m * 2^(e - 62)      with  2^62 <= |m| < 2^63    (m is int64_t)
    zero  = (m = 0, e = 0)                                  (canonical)

Normalizing the mantissa gives ~62 bits of relative precision at EVERY
magnitude. A fixed-point format cannot: covering the range this program needs
(ln down to -22, variates to +/-6.6, user --mean into the thousands, and
log-normal exp() effectively unbounded) costs so many integer bits that the
fraction lands back at double precision having gained nothing.

Rounding is TRUNCATION TOWARD ZERO, everywhere, unconditionally. Not
round-to-nearest. Truncation is trivially reproducible and has no tie-break
rule to get subtly wrong in one of the two implementations.

Never use the `^` operator here: in LuaJIT `^` is floating-point
exponentiation even on integer cdata. Use the POW2 table.
